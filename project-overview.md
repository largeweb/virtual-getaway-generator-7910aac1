# Project Overview

Project Name: Virtual Getaway Generator

Description: A web application that offers simulated personalized virtual vacation experiences. Users input their interests, and the app curates a frontend vacation experience with simulated 360° videos, playlists, and AI-generated stories.

Features:
*   Interest-Based Personalization: Users select from predefined interests (History, Adventure, Relaxation) to tailor their virtual vacation.
*   Simulated Destination Exploration: Browse a selection of 10 pre-loaded virtual destinations. Each destination features mocked 360° videos and a sample local music playlist.
*   Mock AI Story Generation: Based on the user's interest, a short, AI-generated story about the destination is displayed.
*   Simulated Budget Calculation: A simple input field allows users to enter their "budget," which generates a humorous message based on whether the budget is "sufficient" or "insufficient" for the chosen destination.
*   User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive and engaging interface.

Technology Stack:
*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
